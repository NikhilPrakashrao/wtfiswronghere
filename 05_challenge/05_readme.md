a. There were two errors, first is the name of the file was wrong and the second one is there were no braces for the print statement at line 21

b. i didnt knew what to do.. i just googled the error, after that i had some clue and went to file directory and checked that there was a spelling mistake in the code and rectified it. then also the program wasn't running fine, then i changed the code directory to 05_challenge in bash and after that the code was running fine.

c. While running the program we should always check in which directory the code is running.
